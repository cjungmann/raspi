# MINIMAL, AS IN INSTALLED

This page exists as a record of sources of minimal OS installs
for Raspberry Pi.  So I won't lose 'em.

Loading an OS image on an SD case for Raspberry Pi is easy and fast.
This makes it useful for testing fresh installs, as I intend to do.

I am working on some tools with dependencies. I would like to ensure
that I can recognize and remedy any missing dependencies.  For this,
I would like to start with a clean OS with the minimum installed
software.

# OPTION 1: Raspberry Pi Lite
The first obvious candidate is the _lite_ version of the
[rasp_lite][official Raspberry Pi OS].  It comes without a desktop
and productivity software.  I was disappointed that it did include
things like __essential-build__ and __gdb__ and probably a bunch
of other stuff I'm not going to check just yet.

# OPTION 2: DietPi

This may be the end of my search, but I found [dietpi][DietPi],
which may be close enough to what I'm looking for.
